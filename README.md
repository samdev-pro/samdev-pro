# 🏗️ Sam H — Construction Data Engineer & Digital Delivery Specialist

I build automation systems and data pipelines that convert raw construction and field data into polished dashboards and insights. 

By bridging construction tech with data engineering, I help teams replace manual Smartsheet/Excel chaos with scalable analytics and reporting tools.

I enable construction and commissioning teams to move from manual spreadsheets to automated data pipelines and real-time dashboards.
